## 4.0.0-beta1 - 2023-12-07

### Added

-   Navigable minimap, which will display a zoomed-out map of the entire sample.
    In order to navigate the sample, simply click on the location where you want
    your window, or drag the slider in along the horizontal axis.
-   Zoom to selection button, which will make the window the size of the
    selected area. Hotkey is ALT+Z.
-   Option to toggle logarithmic scale on the Y Axis, by @danielkucera.

### Changed

-   The Y axis settings are now moved into a dialog. To open the settings
    dialog, press SETTINGS, in the top left corner of the graph. The dialog
    contains the options to toggle linear or logarithmic scale, and the option
    to lock the Y axis.
-   The chart will now only show positive values along the X axis.
-   Backend for interacting with devices from **nrf-device-lib-js** to **nrfutil
    device**.

### Removed

-   Support for Power Profiler Kit (PPK1). From this release, Power Profiler app
    will only be usable for Power Profiler Kit II (PPK2). In order to use a
    PPK1, use a version before v4.0.0 or replace the deprecated PPK1 with a
    PPK2. Removing support for PPK1 allows us to add new PPK2 features to the
    application.
-   _Real-Time_ pane, as this was mainly intended for the deprecated PPK1. The
    useful Trigger feature will be re-introduced in the _Data Logger_ pane in an
    upcoming release.

### Fixed

-   PPK2 would create noise in the measurement when the LED was pulsing (i.e.
    PWM), a new firmware (power_profiler_2 1_1_0) has been added and will make
    the LED static during sampling. The next time you connect to a PPK2 with an
    old firmware, you will be able to program it with the new version.
-   When changing the sampling parameters in the side panel, after having done a
    sample, it would remove the sample data.
-   Zooming further than what is permitted would cause the graph to pane. This
    is now restricted, which means that if zooming has reached its limit, you
    will need to explicitly pane the graph.
-   Hovering the digital channels would show a horizontal line at the top of the
    graph. Now the horizontal line will only be shown together with the vertical
    line if you hover the graph.

## 3.5.5 - 2023-04-05

### Fixed

-   Linux: Missing nrf-udev installation resulted in the app crashing.

### Known Issue

-   PPK1: Does not work in nRF Connect for Desktop v4.0.1, but will be fixed in
    the next patch release v4.0.2. In order to work with the PPK1, try
    downgrading nRF Connect for Desktop to v4.0.0.

## 3.5.4 - 2023-02-12

### Added

-   Auto reconnect functionality.

### Changed

-   Update to work with nRF Connect for Desktop v4.0.0.

### Fixed

-   Issue in `Real Time` pane, where if you increased the `Length`, the length
    would not be reflected in the window of the next trigger.

## 3.5.3 - 2022-11-28

### Changed

-   New PPK2 firmware. The first time you connect a PPK2 with an older firmware
    version, you will be asked if you want your device to be programmed.

## 3.5.2 - 2022-10-12

### Fixed

-   PPK2 did not show up in **Device Selector** when the appropriate firmware
    was not flashed. This release removes the filtering that was introduced in
    v3.5.0.

## 3.5.1 - 2022-10-5

### Fixed

-   Resuming profiling used to crash.

## 3.5.0 - 2022-09-26

### Known Issue

-   PPK1 measurements may fail after some time with error message: "Corrupt data
    detected, please check connection to PPK". A temporary solution, that we
    have tested, is to manually downgrade JLink firmware on the device to
    v7.58b.

### Added

-   Device filter
    -   When using a PPK2 you should only select the PPK2 in this app.
    -   When using a PPK1 you can use it with any member of the nRF51, nRF52 or
        nRF53 Family.

### Changed

-   Better performance when paning large datasets

-   Export all now works for all new samples.
    -   If you are not able to use export `All` with an older set of samples
        (loaded from a .ppk file), you may use `SELECT ALL` and export selection
        instead.

## 3.4.0 - 2022-02-03

### Added

-   Manually setting y-axis range is now available when `LOCK Y-AXIS` is
    toggled.
-   Export dialog now have a section to choose what selection to export to CSV.
    -   The different options are to export 'All' samples, the samples within
        the 'Window', or a 'Selection'.

## 3.2.0 - 2021-11-01

### Changed

-   Establish compatibility with nRF Connect for Desktop 3.8.

## 3.1.3 - 2021-09-21

### Fixed

-   Two corrupted samples in a row caused all future samples to be corrupt. This
    would be especially likely to happen in long running sessions.

## 3.1.2 - 2021-06-14

### Fixed

-   Chart issues when loading from saved capture file.

## 3.1.1 - 2021-03-10

### Fixed

-   CSV export had an inverted bit sequence.

## 3.1.0 - 2021-02-15

### Added

-   Split the primary view in two, a **data logger** and a **real-time** view.
    With the data logger view the user can examine the power continuously over a
    period of time. In the real-time view, which has similar functionality to an
    oscilloscope, the user can specify a trigger level, and when the consumed
    power reaches this threshold, the power consumption signature in the
    surrounding period of time can be inspected in detail.
-   **Trigger**: Previously only available when using the
    [older, first version of the Power Profiler Kit hardware](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-tools/Development-Tools/Power-Profiler-Kit)
    now triggers can also be set when using the new
    [Power Profiler Kit II (PPK2) hardware](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-tools/Development-Tools/Power-Profiler-Kit-2).
-   Only with the PPK2: Set a **pre or post trigger** by moving the slider above
    the graph, to decide how much time before and after the trigger is relevant
    and will be shown for the next trigger.
-   Average sampling with a lower resolution: When interested in **examining
    power over a longer time span** you can lower the samples per second.
    Sampling is still done at the full resolution, but automatically averaged to
    decrease the storage size. The rate can be lowered as far as only a sample
    per second, enabling sampling for days or even months.
-   Besides the existing CSV export: **Save** the current data in a format to
    **Load** it again later within the app, enabling sharing data and examining
    it at a later time.
-   Easily create **screenshots** of the current graph.

### Changed

-   Raise **limit for displaying digital channels** (on the highest resolution
    they were previously only shown for a time range of up to 3 seconds, now
    they are shown for up to 30 seconds).
-   **Enhanced performance** to make the UI more responsive.
-   Several **minor UI changes** to improve the user experience.

## 3.0.3 - 2020-12-11

### Fixed

-   Small visual glitch when used with nRF Connect for Desktop 3.6.1: The top
    margin in the side panel was shrunken.

## 3.0.2 - 2020-12-11

### Fixed

-   CSV export contained the wrong portion of data.

## 3.0.1 - 2020-12-03

### Fixed

-   Connecting a PPK via J-Link Lite failed.
-   Moving the right handle past the left handle in the chart selection would
    break the values displayed in the selection window.

## 3.0.0 - 2020-12-01

### Changed

-   Complete rewrite of the application. This version supports the old power
    profiler kit, in addition to the newly released PPK2 hardware.

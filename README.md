# nRF Connect Power Profiler

Power Profiler app for [nRF Connect](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pc-nrfconnect-launcher).

## Introduction

*nRF Connect Power Profiler* is a tool to communicate with the [Power Profiler Kit II (PPK2)](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-tools/Development-Tools/Power-Profiler-Kit-2), an affordable and flexible tool to obtain real-time current measurements of your designs. It also supports the [older, first version of the Power Profiler Kit](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-tools/Development-Tools/Power-Profiler-Kit). The PPK measures current consumption for a connected Nordic Development Kit or any external board. It gives a detailed picture of the current profile for the user application.

All functionality is described in the [User Guide](https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/topic/ug_ppk2/UG/ppk/PPK_user_guide_Intro.html) (If you use the first version of the hardware, there is a different [User Guide for the PPK 1](https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/topic/ug_ppk/UG/ppk/PPK_user_guide_Intro.html)).
